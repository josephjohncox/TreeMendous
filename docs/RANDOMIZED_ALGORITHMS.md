## 1. Foundations of Randomized Tree Algorithms

### 1.1 Probability Spaces for Trees

**Definition 1.1** (Tree Probability Space). Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be probability space where:
- $\Omega$: Set of all possible interval trees
- $\mathcal{F}$: $\sigma$-algebra of tree events
- $P$: Probability measure over tree configurations

**Definition 1.2** (Random Tree). A random variable $T: \Omega \to \text{Trees}$ with distribution:
$$P(T = t) = \prod_{v \in t} P(\text{interval}(v)) \cdot P(\text{structure}(t))$$

**Example 1.3** (Random Interval Generation).
- **Uniform**: Start times $\sim \text{Uniform}[0, T_{\max}]$
- **Exponential**: Durations $\sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$
- **Pareto**: Sizes $\sim \text{Pareto}(\alpha, x_m)$ (heavy-tailed)

### 1.2 Randomized Tree Construction

**Algorithm 1.4** (Randomized Insertion).
```
RANDOMIZED-INSERT(tree, interval):
1. With probability p:
   Use standard deterministic insertion
2. With probability 1-p:
   Insert at random position maintaining balance
3. Apply randomized rebalancing:
   - Random rotation with probability q
   - Deterministic rebalancing otherwise
4. Update summary statistics
```

**Theorem 1.5** (Expected Performance). Randomized insertion achieves:
$$\mathbb{E}[\text{insertion\_time}] = O(\log n)$$
with high probability concentration around the mean.

**Proof**: By probabilistic analysis of tree height distribution under random insertions.

### 1.3 Skip List Variant for Intervals

**Definition 1.6** (Interval Skip List). Probabilistic data structure with levels:
- **Level 0**: All intervals in sorted order
- **Level $i$**: Subset of level $i-1$ chosen with probability $p$

**Algorithm 1.7** (Skip List Interval Search).
```
SKIP-LIST-SEARCH(target_interval, skip_list):
1. Start at highest non-empty level
2. Move right until next interval > target
3. Drop down one level
4. Repeat until level 0
5. Linear search in level 0
```

**Theorem 1.8** (Skip List Complexity). With probability $1-1/n$:
- **Search**: $O(\log n)$ expected time
- **Space**: $O(n)$ expected space
- **Insert/Delete**: $O(\log n)$ expected time

---

## 2. Probabilistic Analysis of Tree Performance

### 2.1 Random Tree Models

**Definition 2.1** (Binary Search Tree Model). Insert random permutation of intervals into initially empty tree.

**Theorem 2.2** (Random BST Height). For $n$ random insertions:
$$\mathbb{E}[\text{height}] = O(\log n)$$
with high probability concentration.

**Proof**: Classic analysis using exponential moment generating functions.

**Definition 2.3** (Random Graph Model). Generate intervals as random graph:
- **Vertices**: Time points
- **Edges**: Intervals spanning time points
- **Edge weights**: Interval properties (duration, priority)

### 2.2 Concentration Inequalities

**Theorem 2.4** (Azuma's Inequality for Trees). For martingale sequence $\{X_k\}$ with bounded differences:
$$P(|X_n - \mathbb{E}[X_n]| \geq t) \leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{t^2}{2\sum_{k=1}^n c_k^2}\right)$$

**Application 2.5** (Tree Height Concentration). Tree height concentrates around $O(\log n)$:
$$P(|\text{height} - \mathbb{E}[\text{height}]| \geq t) \leq 2e^{-t^2/(2n)}$$

**Theorem 2.6** (Chernoff Bound for Utilization). For independent interval allocations:
$$P\left(\left|\frac{\text{utilization}}{n} - \mu\right| \geq \epsilon\right) \leq 2e^{-2n\epsilon^2}$$

### 2.3 Tail Bounds and Extreme Values

**Definition 2.7** (Tail Distribution). For tree operation time $T$:
$$\bar{F}(t) = P(T > t)$$

**Theorem 2.8** (Heavy-Tailed Analysis). If intervals follow Pareto distribution:
$$P(\text{interval\_size} > t) = \left(\frac{x_m}{t}\right)^\alpha$$
then tree performance exhibits heavy tails.

**Application 2.9** (Worst-Case Analysis). Design for $99.9\%$ percentile performance:
$$P(\text{operation\_time} \leq t_{99.9}) = 0.999$$

## 3. Randomized Tree Algorithms

### 3.1 Treaps (Tree + Heap)

**Definition 3.1** (Treap). Binary search tree with random priorities:

1. Insert interval maintaining BST property
2. Rotate up until heap property restored
3. Update summary statistics during rotations

2. Rotate down (decrease priority to -∞)
3. Delete when node becomes leaf
```

**Theorem 3.3** (Treap Performance). All operations take $O(\log n)$ expected time with high probability.

### 3.2 Randomized Search

   - Sample random interval from tree
   - Check if interval satisfies target properties
   - Track best candidate found
2. Return best interval or failure

```

**Theorem 3.5** (Sample Complexity). To find feasible interval with probability $1-\delta$:
$$k \geq \frac{\ln(1/\delta)}{\rho}$$
where $\rho$ is fraction of feasible intervals.

**Algorithm 3.6** (Randomized Best-Fit).
```
RANDOMIZED-BEST-FIT(tree, interval_size, samples):
1. candidates = []
2. For i = 1 to samples:
   - interval = tree.sample_random_interval()
   - if interval.size ≥ interval_size:
       candidates.append(interval)
3. Return best candidate from samples
```

### 3.3 Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo

**Definition 3.7** (Las Vegas Algorithm). Always correct, random runtime:
$$P(\text{correct output}) = 1, \quad \mathbb{E}[\text{runtime}] = \text{finite}$$

**Definition 3.8** (Monte Carlo Algorithm). Random output, bounded runtime:
$$P(\text{correct output}) \geq 1-\epsilon, \quad \text{runtime} = O(f(n))$$

**Example 3.9** (Las Vegas Tree Search).
```
LAS-VEGAS-FIND(tree, target):
1. Repeat until found:
   - Choose random search direction
   - If found: return result (always correct)
   - If not found: try different direction
2. Expected time: O(log n)
```

## 14. Probabilistic Analysis Examples

### 14.1 Coupon Collector for Tree Coverage

**Problem**: How many random intervals needed to cover entire time range?

**Definition 14.1** (Coverage Problem). Given time range $[0, T]$, find expected number of random intervals to achieve full coverage.

**Theorem 14.2** (Coupon Collector Bound). If intervals uniformly distributed:
$$\mathbb{E}[\text{intervals needed}] = T \cdot H_T = T \ln T + O(T)$$
where $H_T$ is the $T$-th harmonic number.

**Algorithm 14.3** (Coverage Analysis).
```
ANALYZE-COVERAGE(time_range, interval_distribution):
1. Simulate random interval generation
2. Track coverage using interval tree
3. Use summary statistics to monitor progress:
   - coverage_ratio = tree.total_free / time_range
   - gap_count = tree.get_summary().contiguous_count
4. Estimate completion using coupon collector analysis
```

### 14.2 Balls and Bins for Resource Allocation

**Problem**: Distribute $n$ tasks among $m$ processors.

**Theorem 14.4** (Maximum Load). Throwing $n$ balls into $m$ bins uniformly:
$$P\left(\text{max load} \geq \frac{n}{m} + \sqrt{\frac{2n \ln m}{m}}\right) \leq \frac{2}{m}$$

**Algorithm 14.5** (Power of Two Choices).
```
POWER-OF-TWO-ALLOCATION(tasks, processors):
1. For each task:
   - Choose 2 random processors
   - Query their tree summaries for current load
   - Allocate to processor with lower load
   - Update chosen processor's tree
2. Achieves much better load balance than random allocation
```

**Theorem 14.6** (Improved Load Balance). Power of two choices achieves:
$$\mathbb{E}[\text{max load}] = \frac{n}{m} + \frac{\ln \ln m}{\ln 2} + O(1)$$

### 14.3 Random Graph Models for Interval Conflicts

**Definition 14.7** (Random Interval Graph). Graph $G(n, p)$ where:
- **Vertices**: $n$ intervals
- **Edges**: Conflicts with probability $p$

**Theorem 14.8** (Chromatic Number). For random interval graph:
$$\mathbb{E}[\chi(G)] = \frac{n}{2\ln(np)} + O(1)$$
when $np \to \infty$.

**Application 14.9** (Conflict-Free Scheduling). Use graph coloring to find conflict-free schedules.

```
PROBABILISTIC-INTERVAL-EQUALS(I1, I2):
1. Compute fingerprints: f1 = fingerprint(I1), f2 = fingerprint(I2)

$$P(|f(X_1, \ldots, X_n) - \mathbb{E}[f]| \geq t) \leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{2t^2}{\sum_i c_i^2}\right)$$

**Application 17.3** (Tree Performance Concentration). Tree operation times concentrate around expected values.

### 17.3 Lovász Local Lemma

**Theorem 17.4** (Local Lemma). If events $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ with:
- $P(A_i) \leq p$ for all $i$
- Each $A_i$ dependent on at most $d$ other events
- $ep(d+1) \leq 1$

Then $P(\bigcap_i \overline{A_i}) > 0$ (all events can be avoided).
